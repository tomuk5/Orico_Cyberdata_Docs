**ATX PSU cable**

Wrap the ATx power supply cable to prevent rubbing through the insulation on the rough case and shorting out to ground.

**Chassis grounding**

replace the connection to ground on the PSU with a slide on/clip fit connector.

**NMVe heatspreader shorting**

There are board mounted components whose legs protrude through the board underneath the M.2 NVMe bays where NMVe's will be installed and potentially short out on any headspreaders installed on the NVMe's.
These legs should be clipped back to near flush with the board using a suitable pair of cutters. - be careful with this so as to not trim back entirely flush, as you may disconnect the component entirely or damage your board.


**CPU cooler**

CPU cooler has a 86mm square mounting configuration and the stock cooler is 15mm tall - this is the actual height limit with the case as it stands and can't be increased without modifying the case internally.

There are currently no recommended aftermarket replacements (yet)


**Case fan replacement**

Replacing the rear case fan's with 120mmx25mm fans requires the use of spacers (STL file in STL's directory).
When fitting replacement fans, you will also need to trim back any foam that may foul the fan's movement before fitting the fan. 

Do NOT trim back the foam in the corners where the fan mounts are located, only trim back where the fan blades may foul.
